[build]
  # This command tells Netlify to execute the Next.js build script.
  # 'npm run build' is a standard script in package.json that typically
  # runs 'next build'. This process compiles the application, optimizes
  # static assets, and prepares server-side code for deployment.
  command = "npm run build"

  # The 'publish' directory is where Netlify looks for the static assets
  # and serverless functions generated by the build command. For a Next.js
  # application, this directory is always '.next'. Netlify will deploy
  # the contents of this directory to its global CDN and serverless runtime.
  publish = ".next"
